i am reacreating the popular game, known in the south african streets as casino

the game is very fun to play and consists of 11 points that need to be collected during a round.

the points in the game are:
 - 10 of diamonds(counts as 2 points)
 - 2 of spades(counts as a point and a spade card)
 - 2 A cards count as a  sing point each(4 in the game make 4 points)
 - if a player has more than 5 random spade cards, including A of spades and 2 of spades, it counts as 2 points
 - Any player that has more cards than the rest of the players also counts 2 points because of the number of cards

 -Spade counting and card counting is 4 points in total but only applies in game where there's 2 or 4 players, 3 hands will only count 7 points, being:
 - 10 of diamonds(2 points)
 - 2 of spades
 - A cards
